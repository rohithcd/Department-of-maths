            <h3>Area of research interest: Discrete Mathematics: Graph Theory</h3>
<p>
	My broad area of research interest is Discrete Mathematics with specialization in Graph Theory. Apart from the purely theoretical work in the area, I am interested in the application of Graph Theory in computer science vid network analysis, Sociology vid social network analysis, Chemistry vid spectral graph theory which connects the energy of a molecule to the energy of a graph which represents the structure of the molecule. I am also interested in domination theory which finds application in almost all fields where the system admits a graphical modelling. 
    </p>
	<p>My immediate future plan is to work on two areas – graph labelling and spectral graph theory. In graph labelling, I wish to focus on Leech labelling. The concept was introduced in 1975, motivated by a problem in electrical engineering. In spectral graph theory, three types of energies are well studied – energies defined from adjacency matrix, distance matrix and Laplacian matrix. My research group is looking for another variant which is directly related to a type of energy of a chemical molecule.

<h3>Area of research interest: Convex optimization problem.</h3>

<p>The advantage of convex optimization problem is that every local optima (minima/maxima) is also the global optima (minima/maxima). While my work is mainly based on bilevel optimization problem, I have also worked on Variational inequality problem and Equilibrium problem. A large number of applications are available for the Bilevel optimization problem in statistics, economics, electrical engineering, finance, transportation, environmental science etc. To name a few toll setting problem, natural gas cash out problem, biofuel problems.

<h3>Area of research interest:Operator Theory and Operator Algebras </h3>

<p>My research interests are in Operator Theory and Operator Algebras. In particular non-commutative approximation and extremal theories in the context of operator systems in C*-algebras. Noncommutative approximation have seen tremendous growth in the recent past. One of the main results of the classical approximation theory is the famous Korovkin's theorem  which concerns convergence of positive linear maps on function algebras. The classical extremal theory concerning Choquet boundary of subalgebras of function algebras is a closely related topic of interest. He has established certain non-commuatative analogue of  above mentioned classical results in the setting of C*-algebras. My current interest is to explore the above mentioned classical results in the setting of Hilbert C*-modules.

<p>Area of research interest: </p>

<p>Self-adjoint operators and their spectra play a crucial role in analysis and Physics. Therefore it is natural to ask how to compute the spectrum of a self-adjoint operator. We consider a fundamental problem in operator theory; Can we approximate the spectrum of bounded self-adjoint operators on separable Hilbert spaces. This problem was addressed by many mathematicians in the past. 
The sequence of eigenvalues of the finite dimensional truncations An, were considered to approximate the spectrum σ(A) of a bounded self-adjoint operator A. It was already observed in the literature that the bounds of essential spectrum and the discrete eigenvalues that lie outside these bounds, can be approximated by this method. A class of operators for which this technique works was identified by W. B. Arveson. The major problem that remains to be considered is to predict the existence of gaps that may occur between the bounds of σe(A), the essential spectrum of A, using the eigenvalues of An. When considering self-adjoint operators coming from Chemistry or Mathematical Physics, one is interested in the spectral gaps because they represent the region of instability of the associated eigenvalue problem Au = λu. 
We considered an analytic and random family of operators and proved that the then existing approximation theorems hold for such families. Also an attempt is made to predict the existence of spectral gaps that may occur between the bounds of essential spectrum. We tried to establish the usage of the rich theory of eigenvalue distribution of random matrices spectral ap- proximation problems of infinite dimensional random self-adjoint operators. Recently, Jonathan Ben-Artzi and Thomas Holding considered the similar approach for an analytic family of unbounded operators. 
An important example considered in our study is the discretized Schro ̈dinger operator. This operator arise in several physical phenomena. We proved the discrete versions of the classical B ̈org’s theorem. The result was further generalized in to the case of Jacobi matrices. We proved the discretized version using the rich theory of Laurent-Toeplitz matrices. The main tools are the finite differences for identifying the analogous discrete operators and a for- mulation of the discrete problem in terms of block Toeplitz sequences with p × p matrix-valued symbols. Recently, we obtained the estimate for the possible spectral gaps of such operators. 
We also approach the problem using the notion of preconditioners in the operator theory setting. This is interesting in spectral theory point of view, because the preconditioners play a crucial role in the approximation of spectrum. 
We proved noncommutative Korovkin-type theorems with respect to strong, weak and uniform clustering. These noncommutative Korovkin-type theorems are used to study the infinite dimensional preconditioner problem. As an application, we could generalize the Korovkin type theorems in the setting of preconditioners for Toeplitz operators. We tried to use the notion of preconditioners in the spectral approximation problems. Recently, we have extended these results in to non self-adjoint Toeplitz operators with complex-valued symbols.

<h3>Area of research interest: Wavelets Theory</h3>

<p>My focus on research is basically on both theoretical and applicable aspects of Wavelets theory. As an alternate tool to Fourier analysis wavelets gained so much attention among the scientific community, applied this in various fields not limited to signal analysis and image analysis. As generalized concepts in the same spirit, multiwavelets and Framelets are developed recently. This vast literature helps find the solutions of differential equations and Integral equations. Currently, he focus on these aspects to numerically approximate the solution of well-known differential equations using this tool. He has expertise in the computational aspects of partial differential equations using python, maple, sagemath etc. As a related field, Gabor frames and subdivision schemes are also studying. This technique is useful in computer-aided geometric design and Image processing. All this theory is closely associated with linear algebra techniques, my research group also studies SIMO channel identification problem using linear algebra tools.

<h3>Area of research interest: </h3>


<p>My current interests revolve around studying coarse geometry in the framework of C*-algebras. Currently I am working with equivalent notions of a coarse structure, like that of a uniform structure, proximity relations and asymptotic resemblance relation between subsets of a given set X. The idea is to try and understand the noncommutative versions of these relations, if any that exists, from the perspective of noncommutative coarse geometry. This is an ongoing project with Dr. Elisa Hartmann.

<h3>Area of research interest: Classical and Non-stable algebraic K-theory, and Non-commutative Algebras</h3>

<p>My research interests lie in Classical and Non-stable algebraic K-theory, and Non-commutative Algebras, specifically on Leavitt path algebras, Graph C*-algebras and their K-theory. My work mainly focuses on the K-theory of quadratic modules and  Leavitt path algebras. Algebraic K- theory is a broad research area that interacts with many other branches of mathematics such as algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and number theory and has it’s applications in Mathematical Physics. 
Currently, my research focuses on the structure theory of classical and classical-like groups over rings. In particular, she studies the structure theory of Dickson-Siegel-Eichler-Roy orthogonal group, Petrov’s odd unitary group and the unification problem of classical groups.

<h3>Area of research interest: </h3>

<p>My research area focusses on the applications of Linear Algebra, Wavelet Approximations, Fuzzy Mathematics, Topology, Lattice Theory, Approximation Theory, Fractional Calculus and Optimization Techniques in the field of Signal Processing, Image processing, Neural Networks, Fuzzy Control and Modelling, Mathematical Morphology, Pattern recognition, Prediction and Forecasting.</p>
<p>
The Neural Network has a great potential to learn any complex data to a desired level of accuracy. Neural Networks are applied in every real-world problem especially for Data Analysis, Pattern recognition, prediction and Forecasting. We focus on the mathematical model in deep learning with neural networks using Matrix Theory, Linear transformation, Topology, Lattice theory, Complexity analysis and Fuzzy Logic. We also consider Self-Organizing Maps for the representation of high dimensional data on a low dimensional space and develop a mathematical model using Lattice Group Theory, Linear Algebra and Fuzzy c-means algorithm and its applications in Pattern Recognition, Data Analysis, Medical Image Processing and Speech Recognition. Fractional calculus deals with the non-integer order derivatives and integrals instead of the standard mathematical models of integer-order derivatives and integrals. In recent years, fractional calculus has played a very important role in various fields such as mechanics, robotics, chemistry, biology, economics, notably control theory, and signal and image processing. Through this research, we focus on the numerical computation of fractional derivatives and integrals. The Theory of Fuzzy Soft Sets can codify partial membership concerning a predefined list of attributes. The use of a fuzzy soft set allows us to quantify the quality attributes involved in an assessment context and hence it will improve the effectiveness and validity of our valuation methodology with a real case study. Research encompasses the study of structural properties of fuzzy soft relation and its application in decision making. Mathematical Morphology is a part of image processing and analysis which makes use of mathematical concepts such as set theory, fractal geometry, topology, algebra, lattice theory, etc. In this research area we –focus on feature-based classification and analysis of images. A study of topological aspects of the operators used in mathematical morphology is also included. Wavelet Transform is a method to extract information about signals in both the time and frequency domain. In recent times face detection has gained more interest in the research field. In this research work, we focus on the analysis and approximation studies using Wavelets in face detection problems. Automata theory is also mathematical model of machines and also a suitable tool for multidisciplinary computing and scientific research. The incorporation of graph theory and fuzzy logic to automata theory helps to describe the real-life situations in different dimensions of applications like lexical analysis, pattern recognition, image processing, human trafficking etc. Based on these, we are mainly focusing on the development of a mathematical model of fuzzy automata using antifuzzy graph theory, fuzzy logic, matrix theory etc.

<h3>Area of research interest:Representation theory and Fuzzy Mathematics </h3>

<p>My area of research are Representation theory and Fuzzy Mathematics. Representation theory is the study of concrete realizations of the axiomatic systems of abstract algebra. It originated in the study of permutation group and algebra of matrices. One of the major development in representation theory is modular representation of finite groups. In his PhD work, he studied one of such modular representation G-module (where G is a finite group). Fuzzy mathematics is a branch of mathematics including fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic. In 1971, Rosenfeld introduced the fuzzification of algebraic structures such as fuzzy groups, fuzzy rings etc. In his PhD work, he has fuzzified the algebraic structure G-module and studied the properties of fuzzy G-module. Fuzzy mathematics has many applications in real life. One of my interdisciplinary projects (with the department of zoology), “Study of Antibacterial Effect of Nano silver and Doze optimization through Fuzzy Mathematical Technique”, we optimized the doze of nano silver through fuzzy mathematical technique and proved that this optimization is more precise, compared to the doze optimization through conventional methods. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets and Neutrosophic sets are the generalizations of fuzzy set theory. One can apply these generalizations in Engineering, Science, etc.
